            <p>The first year Engineering course – “Engineering Exploration” is one of the unique outcomes of innovative education ecosystem of Shri Guru Gobind Singhji Institute of Engineering and Technology Nanded. This is team-taught course that focuses on problem solving, Engineering Design, Multi-disciplinary skills, Ethics and Data Acquisition &amp; Analysis. This course is co-designed and co-taught by faculty members drawn from multiple engineering disciplines &amp; it follows Project Based Learning (PBL) pedagogy. Students work in teams to solve identified problems. This course serve as a platform for peer learning and push students in Multi-disciplinary design thinking in first year itself.</p>
            <p>The focus of the course is on “Engineering Design Process”, covering broad themes of environmental, educational, smart appliances, smart agriculture, industrial needs etc. are used by students to carve out problem definitions. Project implementation is done by students using Arduino, NodeMCU, Raspberry-Pi, GSM Module, GPS Module, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi platform. This Course provides an opportunity for freshman students to learn in new ecosystem.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Course Objectives:</h4>
            <p>Identify multi-disciplinary approach required in solving an engineering problem.
            build simple systems using engineering design process.</p>
